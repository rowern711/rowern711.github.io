title: Litany at Dawn
pillar: Theology

In this meditation on the **theology pillar**, we walk through a sunrise service, balancing ritual with restless questions. The cadence is casual but reverent, with scripture riffs, coffee steam, and the quiet relief of doubt welcomed at the door.

> Faith is a conversation, not a verdict. Bring your contradictions.

We close with a brief benediction and a couple of readings you can remix in future posts.
