title: Stoic Sidewalk Talk
pillar: Philosophy

Grab a hoodie, queue up some lo-fi, and pace through a street-level take on virtue ethics. This entry keeps the **philosophy pillar** playful—riffing on Epictetus, subway delays, and the moral weight of sharing your last slice.

Key beats:

- What counts as control when your phone battery is at 3%?
- Why the dichotomy of control feels like skateboarding down a hill.
- An invitation to disagree loudly but kindly in the comments.
