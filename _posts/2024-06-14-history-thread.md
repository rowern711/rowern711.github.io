Under the **history pillar**, this post tells one story three times: once from the archives, once from the street, and once from the memory of someone who was there. The tone stays half-joking, half-sincere—like a friend nudging you to read the footnotes.

Try sprinkling in:

- A primary quote
- A quick correction to a popular myth
- A modern echo that makes the story feel present
